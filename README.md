# DISCLAIMER
I am not at fault for your fucked up documents. Only use this if you completely trust *code running continuously on your Google Doc*. Preferably on docs where there are no collaborators.

# GDocs-Paper

## Features
* Monospace backticks to write `code`.
* Insert in the current date when you write `/date`.

## Using (WIP)

1. Open the GDoc you want to attach this to.
2. Click on "Tools/Script Editor".
3. Paste in this script, and run `onOpen()`
4. Go to "Utilities/Start GDocs-Paper" and it should be running!
